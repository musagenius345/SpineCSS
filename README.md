SpineCSS is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

## Warning: Work in Progress!

SpineCSS is a passion project that we've been working on for some time, and we're excited to share it with the world. However, we want to be clear that this is a long-term project and a work in progress. While the framework is stable and usable, there may be bugs, inconsistencies, or missing features that we haven't yet discovered.

That being said, we encourage you to dive into SpineCSS and explore its many features and capabilities. Use it to spin out your own design system and create beautiful, responsive websites and applications. But please be aware that this is a living, evolving project, and changes may be made to the framework over time.

In short, use SpineCSS at your own risk, but don't let that stop you from exploring its many possibilities. We're committed to making this framework the best it can be, and we're excited to see what you can create with it!

## Credits

SpineCSS was built on top of the popular [Skeleton CSS framework](https://github.com/dhg/skeleton.git), and we would like to thank Dave Gamache for his work on Skeleton. We would also like to acknowledge Andy Bell's Modern CSS Reset, which provided inspiration for our normalization approach.
