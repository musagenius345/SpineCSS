# [SpineCSS](#)
SpineCSS is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.


## Getting started

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/musagenius345/SpineCSS.git` (Note: this is under active development)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, [Andy Bell's Modern CSS Reset](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/modern-css-reset) as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── reset.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
